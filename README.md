## ARI Workspace 

### Introduction
| The ARI workspace contains all the files for the robot management. The main files developed are those for the calibration, the control and the talking / listening to the robot.  | <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.squarespace-cdn.com%2Fcontent%2Fv1%2F615ef432328446710cb07969%2F1646651854249-NDOV5VC9Q0OI5RBQ4RAW%2FARI_2.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=3c219b69e95f1ddf0d4755ba09de3f81d22b73784a981dd9418411b109dac360&ipo=images" width=500> |

### Setup
To setup and start working with ARI you need to follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository into the docker on your computer
2. Source the main files external the workspace
>###### Ros setup
>```bash
>source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
>```

>###### Pal setup
>```bash
>source /opt/pal/ferrum/setup.bash
>```

>###### Connect to ARI 16-c
>```bash
>export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://ari-16c:11311
>```

>###### Set the IP of the computer
>Remember to set the IP of the computer to the one of the docker. In this case the IP is:
>```bash
>export ROS_IP=<your IP address>
>```

>###### Run Rviz for ARI
>To have the position of ARI in the map and all the features of the robot you need to run the following command:
>```bash
>rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find ari_2dnav`/config/rviz/navigation.rviz
>```
### Files
The main files of the workspace are:
<!--Todo-->
- **calibration**: Contains the files for the calibration of the robot using ArUco markers
- **control**: Contains the files for the control of the robot
- **talking**: Contains the files for the talking and listening to the robot
- **launch**: Contains the launch files for the robot

### Launch
Each launch file is used to start a specific part of the robot, or one to start them simultaneously. 
To start the robot speech node you need to run the following command:
```bash
roslaunch ari_pkg speech.launch
```
To start the robot control and calibration node you need to run the following command:
```bash
roslaunch ari_pkg detect.launch
```

### Talking
The talking part of the robot is used to make the robot speak and listen to the user.
You can ask to the robot also to go to a point of interest and it will go. For the moment you can only say some specific words associated to the point of interest, you can find them in the file `scripts/points_of_interest.json`.

You can also start single nodes for the speech part of the robot, like the talking part is made only in the speech.py file. You can start it with the following command:
```bash
rosrun ari_pkg talk.py
```

Or if you want to test the moving part given by vocal commands you can start the following node:
```bash
rosrun ari_pkg move.py
```
but remember that you need to have another shell open where you send a string with the phrase you want to say to the robot. You can do it with the following command:
>```bash
>rosrun ari_pkg move.py
>```
>```bash
>rostopic pub /speech std_msgs/String "data: 'Vai alla docking station'"
>```
