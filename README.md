### Setup
To setup and start working with ARI you need to follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository into the docker on your computer
2. Source the main files external the workspace
>###### Ros setup
>```bash
>source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
>```

>###### Pal setup
>```bash
>source /opt/pal/ferrum/setup.bash
>```

>###### Connect to ARI 16-c
>```bash
>export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://ari-16c:11311
>```

>###### Set the IP of the computer
>Remember to set the IP of the computer to the one of the docker. In this case the IP is:
>```bash
>export ROS_IP=<your IP address>
>```

>###### Run Rviz for ARI
>To have the position of ARI in the map and all the features of the robot you need to run the following command:
>```bash
>rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find ari_2dnav`/config/rviz/navigation.rviz
>```
### Files
The main files of the workspace are:
<!--Todo-->
- **calibration**: Contains the files for the calibration of the robot using ArUco markers
- **control**: Contains the files for the control of the robot
- **talking**: Contains the files for the talking and listening to the robot
- **launch**: Contains the launch files for the robot

### Launch
Each launch file is used to start a specific part of the robot, or one to start them simultaneously. 
To start the robot you need to run the following command:
```bash
roslaunch ari_pkg speech.launch
```

### Talking
The talking part of the robot is used to make the robot speak and listen to the user.
You can ask to the robot also to go to a point of interest and it will go. For the moment you can only say some specific words associated to the point of interest:
 - **ari_16c_dockstation**: "dock", "ricarica", "stazione"
 - **poi_name**: "keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"

To start the talking part of the robot you need to run the following command:
```bash
python scripts/speech.py
```
